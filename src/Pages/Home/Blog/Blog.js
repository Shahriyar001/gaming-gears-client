                        What is harm about gaming?
                    </div>
                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>While gaming can have many benefits, there are also potential harms associated with it. Here are a few examples:

                            Addiction: Gaming can be highly addictive, especially for individuals who have a tendency to become absorbed in activities. This can lead to a neglect of other important areas of life, such as work, relationships, and self-care.

                            Physical health: Gaming often involves long periods of sitting and can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can contribute to health issues such as obesity, back pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

                            Mental health: Excessive gaming can also negatively impact mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and social isolation.

                            Violence: Some types of games, particularly those that involve graphic violence or aggression, can desensitize individuals to real-life violence and increase aggressive tendencies.

                            Cyberbullying: Online gaming communities can sometimes become toxic environments where players engage in harassment, bullying, or discrimination towards each other.

                            It's important to note that not everyone who plays video games will experience these negative effects, and many gamers lead healthy, balanced lives. However, it's important to be aware of the potential harms associated with gaming and to take steps to minimize these risks.</p>
